# AdventOfCode2024
A repository for the solutions for the 2024 Advent of Code event that is starting December 1st, 2024. Information can be found here: https://adventofcode.com/2024/about

# How is this going to happen?
Each new day starting December 1st, the event will show a new challenge to be solved through code. 

# How the repository works?
P.S.: I'm just writing for the sake of documentation but as of now (28/11) we don't have any specific way decide to approach this, so yeah. Not sure if we could use PRs? How to notify? Really not decided yet.

1. Each dev that uses will create a folder with their name
2. Each folder with the dev name will create a sub-folder/file of the solution with the format challenge_day_N, being N the number of the day
3. Commit the solution under their folder so everyone can access and check what they did for the problem, and promote discussion.
